Lagan Boolean Property Controller
================================

Controller for the Lagan Boolean property.  
This can't actually be a "real" boolean because this breaks Lagan. Thats why we use a 0 or a 1 instead.

To be used with [Lagan](https://github.com/lutsen/lagan). Lagan lets you create flexible content objects with a simple class, and manage them with a web interface.

Lagan is a project of [LÃºtsen Stellingwerff](http://lutsen.net/).
